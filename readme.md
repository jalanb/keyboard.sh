# Keyboard.sh

This repo contains my best command abbreviations for a bash shell


## ~/.bashrc

This is where the magic happens

This repo solves a problem I first saw on Xenix, but didn't get help on till Solaris, and started saving on RedHat. Then I found GitHub, and it started to grow, from a line at the end of a `~/.bashrc` to [a sprawling repo on GitHUb](https://github.com/jalanb/jab), and some side-projects.

`keyboard.sh` elevates [a sub-dir in that repo](https://github.com/jalanb/jab/tree/__main__/src/bash/keyboard) to full project.

`keyboard.sh` provides the shotest possible names for commands I use often. `keyboard.sh` prefers repetition, for example it has the command `l` for `ls`, so it has  `bash` commands `ll` and `lll` as well. It uses `l` for `log` in `git`, where it adds `ll`, `lll`, `llll`, `lllll`, ...

`keyboard.sh` looks at the `keyboard` for other commands. In `bash` it uses `l` for `ls`, and the next `l...` commands will be `lo` and `lk`, not `la`, `lb`,  ... And definitely not `la` - an `a` is in the other hand from an `l`! Too far.

And the forums replied "`Premature Abbreviation is the root of all evil`"
